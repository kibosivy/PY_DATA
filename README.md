## Week 1: NumPy Foundations

### 🔹 Introduction to NumPy & Python Data Types
- Understanding NumPy’s role in numerical computing.
- Python's core data types (integers, floats, booleans, lists, etc.).

### 🔹 NumPy Arrays
- Array creation, reshaping, indexing, and slicing.
- Data types in NumPy arrays.

### 🔹 Universal Functions & Aggregations
- Applying mathematical operations across arrays.
- Summary statistics like `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.std()`.

### 🔹 Broadcasting & Comparisons
- Broadcasting rules for operations on differently shaped arrays.
- Boolean masking and advanced (fancy) indexing.

### 🔹 Structured Data & Sorting
- Working with heterogeneous data in arrays.
- Sorting values and structured arrays.

### ✅ **Project**: NumPy Practice Challenges

## Week 2: pandas for Data Analysis

### 🔹 Introduction to pandas
- Series and DataFrame objects.
- Data indexing, slicing, and selection.

### 🔹 Data Operations
- Arithmetic operations between datasets.
- Handling missing data with `.fillna()`, `.dropna()`.

### 🔹 Hierarchical Indexing
- Multi-level indexing for complex datasets.

### 🔹 Combining Datasets
- `concat`, `append`, `merge`, `join` methods.

### 🔹 Aggregation & Pivot Tables
- Grouping data with `.groupby()`.
- Reshaping using pivot tables.

### 🔹 Strings & Time Series
- Vectorized string operations.
- Working with dates, time stamps, and time-indexed data.

### ✅ **Project**: pandas Data Analysis Project

## Week 3: Data Visualization & GeoPandas

### 🔹 Visualisation with Matplotlib
- Basic plots: line, scatter, histograms.
- Customising plots: legends, color bars, ticks, subplots.

### 🔹 Visualisation with Seaborn
- High-level statistical plots: boxplots, heatmaps, distribution plots.

### 🔹 GeoPandas and Geospatial Data
- Installing and using GeoPandas.
- Working with shapefiles, GeoDataFrames, and spatial joins.
- Map customization and projections.
